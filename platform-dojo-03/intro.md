## Challenge intro
In this challenge, you are asked to setup a proper codebase and write an Ansible Playbook
which automatically installs and runs: `Tomcat9 web server`.

More detailed instructions will be provided inside each step, but keep in mind the following:

- Read the instructions thoroughly and make sure you have understood them, if there is any
  uncertainty don't hesitate to ask in the channel    
- Keep your code clean, simple and organized  
- Being able to work within the outlined development process is as important to the challenge
  as the end result itself
