## Dev Process

For the implementation of this challenge you're asked to use the GitFlow branching strategy,
which basically means:

- you need to branch out from `develop`
- your feature branch should be prefixed accordingly (feature-*)
- in order to merge your code into "develop" you need to create a pull request
- your work is basically done once your code has been merged into "develop"
